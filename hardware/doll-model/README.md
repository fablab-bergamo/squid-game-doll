## Attribution

* Models inspired by FABRI_CREATOR https://cults3d.com/:558891
* Source model by Vadi https://cults3d.com/:563983 (consider supporting the artist!)

## Changes

* Added support in the head to add a vertical screw
* Enlarged loudspeaker holes to allow USB/cable to exit the doll
* Added SG90 tower support to be glued on the legs & dress base

## Printing

* Dark PLA for head, white PLA / ABS for other parts, finish with acrylic painting tips.

## Possible improvements

* Design an SG 90 holder inside the trunk element rather than the holder to be glued.
